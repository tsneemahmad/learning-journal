### the ABC of programming 
##### 1/a what is a script and how do i create one?
A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.
You could compare scripts to any of the following: 
- recipes. 
- handbook. 
- manual.
scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step by step.
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
1. define the goal.
2. design the script.
3. code each step.

Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can
understand and follow.

Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.The flowcharts show the paths between each step. 

### Expressions
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.

### Operators
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

**arithmetic operator**
like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, increment and decrement.

**string operator**
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it. Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one
new string concatenation. 

### Functions
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
