### how do i write a script for a web page?

**HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER**
- <html>
CONTENT LAYER
. html files
This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

- {css}
PRESENTATION LAYER
.css files
The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).

- javascri pt()
BEHAVIOR LAYER
.js files
This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interact ivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

**PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT**
- HTML ONLY
Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most
important thing about your site: its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.

- HTML+CSS
Adding the CSS rules in a separate fi le keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster to load and easier
to maintain. Or you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.

- HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the si te. Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).


### basic javascript instructions

**statements**
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.

**comments**
You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

**what is a variable?**
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

**data type**
- NUMERIC DATA TYPE
The numeric data type handles numbers.
- STRING DATA TYPE
The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.
- BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.
