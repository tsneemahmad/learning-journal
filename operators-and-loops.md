### comparison operators:
evaluating conditions
 you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be a boolean: true or false.

 == : is equal to
 it compares two values to see if they are the same.
 != : is not equal to
 it compares two values to see if they are not the same.
 === : strict equal to
 it compares two values to check that both the data and value are the same.
 !== : strict not equal to
 it compares two values to check  that both the data and value are not the same.
 

 ### logical operators
 comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
 - && : logical and
 - || : logical or
 - ! : logical not

 ### loops
 loops check a condition. if it returns, a code block will run. then the condition will be checked again and it still returns true, the code block will run again. it repeats until the coondition returns false. there are three common types of loops:
 - for
 - while 
 - do while

 ### loops counters
 a for loop uses a counter as a condition. this instucts the code to run a specified niumber of times. here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:
 - initialization
 - condition
 - update

 ### USING WHILE LOOPS
 This loop will continue to run
for as long as the condition in
the parentheses is true. That
condition is a counter indicating
that, as long as the variable
i remains less than 10, the
statements in the subsequent
code block should run.
