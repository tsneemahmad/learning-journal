# computers are changing the world

## how do computers work?

 **what makes a computer a computer?**
when the pioneer designed a thinking machine they relized it has to perform 4 different tasks.
1. input the data.
types of input:
- keyboard.
- mouse.
- microphone.
- camera.

2. storage.
like memory.
3. processing.
using algorithem a series of command. 
4. output information.
- text.
- photos.
- videos.
- games.
- VR.
- signals to control robot.

 **how information is represented using electricity?**
ones and zeros do play a big role in how computer work from the inside.
inside a computers there's wires and circiuts carry all the information.
with one wire you can have one bit which the smallest information computer can store. with more wires more bits with more bits you can represent more complex information.

 **how computers use circiuts?**
the electrical signals in the circiuts are the backbone of how all computers do the previous 4 tasks.
in order to process all the information that comes in as input and to make the information tha output computer needs to modify and combine the input signals, to do this a computer uses a million of tiny electronic components which come togther to form circiut

 **the 4 parts of a computer**
- _input_ converts physical input to binary information.
- _memory_ stores information.
- _CPU_ central process unitcalculates information.
- _output_ converts information to physical output.

 **software controls hardware**
 CPU is a master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. it has circiuts to do math and logic and other circiuts to send service.
 software tells the CPU what to do.
 _operating system_ the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
