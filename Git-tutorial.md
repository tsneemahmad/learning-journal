# what is Git?

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit —
Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git.


## Getting Started
**Download Git**
In order to use Git, your computer must have it available. If you 
already have Git on your computer, you should make sure you have 
the latest version.
Git can be installed in three ways:
- Install as a package
- Install via another installer
- Download and compile the source code.

### Setting up a Git Repository

**Cloning**
You can also create a copy of an existing Git repository from a 
particular server by using the clone command with a repository’s URL

**Check File Status**
To determine the state of files, utilize the git status command

**Committing a File**
After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes 
and record what you did within the commit message
