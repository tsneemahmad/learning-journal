            This chapter discussing a process that
            you can use when you are creating a new
            website.
            it covers all these topics:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    1. How to understand the audience your site may attract and
                    what information they will expect to find on it:
                    Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to
                    understand who your target audience is. 
                </li>
                <li>
                 2. How to organize information so that visitors can find what
                they are looking for:
                Now that you know what needs to appear
                on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections 
                or pages.The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used 
                to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how 
                those pages can be grouped.   
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Design theory for presenting information in a way that
                    helps visitors achieve their goals:
                    A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
                    and how much space it might require.By creating a wireframe you can
                    ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. Design tips to help you create more attractive and
                    professional sites:
                    - CONTENT.
                    - Prioritizing.
                    - Organizing.
